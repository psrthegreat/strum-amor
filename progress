Pre-Milestone
- svm classifier on different reps of features
	- MFCC
		- chroma
		- realizing chroma was better
		- trained svm on chroma, concat, middle frame, and mode.
		- good results by overfitting the svm. Chroma was a good representation
		  of the features. Chroma was seen to be independent of octaves. 

Checkpoint 1
Wanted to be able to handle wave files of different lengths.
- softmax regresssion, better than svm since no n^2.  
- combine softmax results with p(y|x) naive bayes model.

Checkpoint 2
Mixture of Gaussians with labelled zi's. Putting together with hidden
markov model, viterbi decoding to figure out most likely sequence. 


Notes
- Used mfcc as baseline. Have performed well in other music analysis tasks.
- using different window sizes
- using 24 bins for pcp
- confusion matrices
- use 24s
- VOICEBOX
-change tolerance parameter lda
