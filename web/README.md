How To Setup!

1. Before doing anything, make sure you have the following installed:
	- npm
	- node
	- To make sure you have these, enter "node" into the terminal. An interpreter
	should open. Similarly some options should popup upon entering "npm".
2. The following are already installed in the folder:
	- nodemon
	- jade
	- stylus
	- mongodb
	- mongoose
	- connect-mongo
	- nodemailer
   However, you should also install nodemon and mongodb globally before the next steps.
3. Now start mongodb shell by typing "mongod" in another terminal window. This
   is required because we need to open mongodb connection.
4. Now run "nodemon app.js" to start a local webserver. It'll start the server
   at "localhost:3000"
5. Install git and fork the repo on github. When major changes are made, simply pull request
6. We all have our own folders under "indiv" to use for storing files that
   are private to the work carried out.
